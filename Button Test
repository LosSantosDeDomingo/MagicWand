/*
  Code Purpose:
  This code is the first testing code for the embedded system project.
  The purpose of this code was to test out the tactile push button, by
  testing how it would respond to the built-in LED on the ESP32.

// Initialize Variables
const int BUILTIN_LED = 2;
const int Button = 36;
int buttonCondition = 0;

void setup() {
  // Initialize Pins to components
  pinMode(BUILTIN_LED, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(Button, INPUT);
}

void loop() {
  // Checks the condition of the button by reading if it is a 0 or 1.
  buttonCondition = digitalRead(Button);

  // Condition to make the LED blink when the button is pressed
  if (buttonCondition == HIGH){
    blinkLED();
  }
  delay(10);
}

// Function to make the LED Blink
void blinkLED(){
  digitalWrite(BUILTIN_LED, HIGH);  // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
  digitalWrite(BUILTIN_LED, LOW);   // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                      // wait for a second
